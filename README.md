## 🧠 Why This Project?

> *"If AI can predict the weather, why not help predict a pandemic’s path?"*

This idea began with a previous project where I used machine learning to forecast weather. That curiosity led me to apply similar techniques to COVID-19 — aiming to create something insightful, timely, and interactive.
